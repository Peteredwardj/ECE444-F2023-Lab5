<h2>Test-Driven Development</h2>

__Pros__:

**Improved Code Quality**<br>
TDD requires every part of the code to be tested, expecting developers to write tests for each functionality and ensure that they work properly and as intended.

**Identifying Bugs**<br>TDD helps us test and think about edge cases that we might have missed during development, this reduces problems from happening during production which might be difficult to debug and critical.

**Faster development**<br>Though it might take time to actually write the tests initially, tests help reduce debugging and reduce errors. With having to spend less time debugging errors, the projectâ€™s lifecycle will be much faster.

**Documentation**<br>Test cases could be used as a point of reference for developers to understand and work with the codebase, such as identifying what an implementation does exactly and what kind of cases it should handle. 

__Cons:__

**Time-consuming**<br>Having to create tests might take time and slow down development, not ideal for an upcoming deadline or a fast paced project.

**May be difficult to maintain**<br>As time goes by, the codebase may get more involved and complicated, and an implementation of something might also affect other implementations. With this, it might be difficult to maintain the tests as they could get more and more complex.

**Overtesting**<br>Some implementations may not require tests, but developers could easily get carried away and write tests that may not even be necessary reducing their productivity in working on the implementation itself.
